			             <p>I am a 21st Century Leaner from <a href="http://www.dlsl.edu.ph/">De La Salle Lipa.</a> Under a Lasallian institution, a social-based framework guides my understanding between education, application and engagement. In this array, I had developed values such as confidence, efficiency, and loyalty; also desires to acquire consistency, open-mindedness and critical thinking.</p>

			             <p>With the CAPSTONE Initiatives, I strive with the optimum of my abilities and parameters. Joined by a team of remarkable people, I want to lead a group who is amiable, competent and compelling. As much as possible, I will lead to what I could afford  to fulfill a commitment of comradery. Soon, we will make CAPSTONE a team-building activity!</p>

			             <p>I want our CAPSTONE to be a progression of character and rationality. Supposed not to be an academic achievement, but a milestone of moral character as an effective 21st Century Learner. I'll devise it professionally though socially to maximize effieciency with my groupmates. It is creating a pleasant working environment and providing quality outputs.</p>

			             <p>A wholesome objective, but the execution? This year implemented a whole knuckle of changes, promised to improve the students' engagement. Since curriculum pressed heavier standards in part of the students, I ponder how could the latter party, the stakeholders, be able to guide the former in accomplishing a year of great ordeals.</p>
